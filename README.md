# Recruitment Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a recruitment dataset, focusing on predicting hiring decisions based on candidate attributes. The goal is to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing hiring decisions and to build a robust predictive model.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

- **Age**: Age of the candidate.
- **Gender**: Gender of the candidate (0: Male, 1: Female).
- **EducationLevel**: Highest level of education attained by the candidate.
- **ExperienceYears**: Number of years of professional experience.
- **PreviousCompanies**: Number of previous companies where the candidate has worked.
- **DistanceFromCompany**: Distance in kilometers from the candidate's residence to the hiring company.
- **InterviewScore**: Score achieved by the candidate in the interview process.
- **SkillScore**: Assessment score of the candidate's technical skills.
- **PersonalityScore**: Evaluation score of the candidate's personality traits.
- **RecruitmentStrategy**: Strategy adopted by the hiring team for recruitment.
- **HiringDecision**: Outcome of the hiring decision (0: Not hired, 1: Hired).

## Notebook Contents
